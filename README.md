# barebones
A barebones WordPress theme made to satisfy WordPress' need for a theme

This was built to be installed alongside the Oxygen visual site builder. Since Oxygen is actually a plugin, WordPress still requires a theme to be installed even though it isn't being used. Install Barebones to satisfy WordPress.
